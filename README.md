# Simple React Application with React Router v6.4
This is a simple React application built with React Router version 6.4, utilizing various hooks such as useLocation, useRouteError, useParams, and useLoader. Additionally, a custom browser router has been implemented.

## Features
- React Router v6.4: The application utilizes the latest version of React Router, version 6.4, which provides an efficient and declarative way to handle routing in the React application.

- useLocation: The useLocation hook from React Router is employed to access and interact with the current URL location. This allows components to dynamically respond to changes in the URL and extract relevant information.

- useRouteError: The useRouteError hook helps handle errors that may occur during routing. It allows you to define error boundaries and provide custom error handling logic.

- useParams: The useParams hook allows you to extract parameters from the URL, enabling dynamic routing and accessing specific information related to a particular route.

- useLoader: The useLoader hook is utilized to manage loading states and display loading indicators or placeholders while asynchronous data or resources are being fetched.

- Custom Browser Router: A custom implementation of the browser router has been created, which provides routing functionality throughout the application. This custom router ensures seamless navigation and allows for additional customization.
